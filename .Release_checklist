Before merge to Master:
-----------------------
1) Settings folder
    -> updates.json : check true/false for each update
    -> setting.json : check that the new updates in updates.json are also present in setting.json
    
2) manifest.json -> bump version number

3) Sync all Firefox changes to Chrome version - exclude firefox-only parts.

Manual tests for popup menu 
----------------------------
1) When on archived page, check add to Excluds list, temp exclude functionality and save page again.

2) When on excluded page, check incllude and temporary include page and save page now.

3) When on temp excluded site, see clear temp exclude and add temp excluded site to Excludes list.

4) When on temp included site, see clear temp include and include site from now buttons. 

5) Check alerts messages in each of the above for 3 cases :  when on excludes, when on temp excludes , when on temp includes.

6) Save page button should work.

7) In firefox, save page as pdf button should hide header and print pdf. 

8) In chrome, check if firefox specific code is removed. (remove auto-toggle reader mode checkbox in settings page as only firefox supports it, remove pageaction listener as in chrome , we use browser action. See #2 issue for reason) 

Manual tests for settings page:
------------------------------

1) Check add and remove from Excludes functionality

2) Check disable waybackeverywhere on launch mode. Enable it, restart browser and addon should start in disabled state , i.e no redirection. Uncheck, restart browser, addon should start  in enabled state i.e provide redirection.

3) Check reset button.

4) Help button

Functionality check:
-------------------

1) Load https://gnu.org and see redirection to archived version.

2) Load a new article which is already not archived, from a news site etc and see if auto-save is happening. 

3) Load quora.com and see if it gets auto-added to excludes list. 

4) Add fsf.org to excludes, then save a page from fsf.org , see if save page is loaded (Since we auto-unwarp prefixes when the host is in excludes, but save page is exception as user intends to see saved page from archive!)

5) Load some archived page, click on a github repo link or youtube link and see if URL auto-unwraps prefixes since domain is in excludes)

6) Load an archived page and try to click signup and signin button. Should add to excludes on the fly and load live page. 

7) See the condition which unwraps URL to live URL for download links when URL ends with a commonly known file extension (this list should be shown in advanced user page or when logging is toggled in settings page) 

8) See if Tracking ID like UTM are filtered out before routing to Wayback MAchine, so we will only end up saving clean links. 

9) See if temp excludes and temp includes are cleared when browser restarts.
