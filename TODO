1. Fix CSS in Settings.html (Success/Error Messages don't show up properly in phone/tablet screensizes)
2. Update Settings page's Add to Exclude/Remove to Exclude buttons to handle different types of links/URLs
3. Make Popup menu display buttons based on if a hostname is in Temporary excluded/temporary included list or not
   (currently we just check and display include/exclude buttons based on currently loaded URL)
